/**
 * @0gkit/mcp
 *
 * The neutral 0G MCP server. Every 0G primitive — Storage, Compute (inference),
 * Data Availability, native chain (faucet/balance), and TEE attestation — is
 * exposed as an `og_*` MCP tool so Claude / Cursor / Cline / any agent runtime
 * drives 0G directly. Foundry ships as a separate, opt-in plugin loaded only
 * when configured (ZEROG_FOUNDRY=1); it is absent by default.
 *
 * Run as a stdio MCP server:
 *   npx @0gkit/mcp
 *
 * Or wire programmatically:
 *   import { create0gMcpServer } from '@0gkit/mcp';
 *   const server = await create0gMcpServer();
 *   await server.connect(transport);
